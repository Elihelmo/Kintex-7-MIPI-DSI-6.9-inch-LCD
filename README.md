## Introduction

This repository provides a complete solution for connecting a 6.9-inch TFT LCD display to a Kintex-7 FPGA using the MIPI DSI interface. The project includes hardware description language (HDL) files, a Vivado project, and example code for display control. 

The MIPI DSI protocol allows for high-speed data transmission, making it suitable for high-resolution displays. This project is ideal for developers looking to integrate LCD displays into their FPGA designs.

## Features

- **High-Speed Data Transfer**: Utilizes MIPI DSI for fast communication.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGAs.
- **HDL Code**: Includes Verilog HDL files for easy customization.
- **Example Projects**: Comes with example designs to get you started quickly.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for installation and usage.

## Hardware Requirements

To get started, you will need the following hardware:

- **Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA Board**: Ensure it supports MIPI DSI.
- **6.9-inch TFT LCD Display**: Make sure it is compatible with the MIPI DSI protocol.
- **Power Supply**: Appropriate voltage for your FPGA and display.
- **Cables**: For connecting the display to the FPGA board.

## Software Requirements

You will need the following software tools:

- **Xilinx Vivado**: This project is developed using Vivado. Make sure you have the correct version installed.
- **Verilog HDL**: Familiarity with Verilog is helpful for modifying the code.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elihelmo/Kintex-7-MIPI-DSI-6.9-inch-LCD.git
   ```

2. **Open Vivado**: Launch the Vivado IDE.

3. **Create a New Project**: Select "Create New Project" and follow the prompts to set up a new project.

4. **Add Source Files**: Import the HDL files from the cloned repository into your project.

5. **Set Up Constraints**: Ensure you have the correct constraints for your FPGA board.

6. **Synthesize and Implement**: Run synthesis and implementation in Vivado.

7. **Download the Bitstream**: Once implementation is complete, download the bitstream to your FPGA.

8. **Connect the Display**: Wire the display to the FPGA according to the pin configuration in the documentation.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project and connected the hardware, you can start using the LCD display. Here are some basic commands to control the display:

- **Initialize Display**: Call the initialization function to set up the display.
- **Display Image**: Use the provided functions to send image data to the display.
- **Clear Screen**: Implement a function to clear the display when needed.

Refer to the example projects in the repository for detailed code snippets.
